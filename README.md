# MULTIDM 2.0

This is Alec's 2nd version of MultiDM. A popular slack app which allows people to send the same DM to multiple people in 1 slash command. 

### Who's used it?

 Yelp, Uber, Shopify, Vistaprint, Twilio, Epic Games, YC, Chick-fila, Codecademy, etc.

## What's Version 2.0

MultiDM 1.0 was poorly built. It was built over a weekend hackathon. I also built it as a very inexperienced developer. The code was poorly written and riddled with bugs. 

Hence, version 2! 

It's built entirely in Go. Go, being a typed language, has helped me keep the code bug-free. The code is **far** superior to version 1. 

## Features

Use /multidm to send the same message to multiple people

## Coming Features

1. Schedule MultiDMs on a certain time and date
2. Make a list of recipients, so you could do:
  
  /multidm @engineering-team hey is this fixed?

## Thanks For Checking Out MultiDM!
